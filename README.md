🌿 Leaf Classification Using CNN & Machine Learning
A deep learning solution that classifies leaf samples from various tree species based on their shape, texture, and other features. Built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and traditional Machine Learning methods, this project identifies leaf types with high accuracy.

🚀 Project Overview
Identifying tree species by leaf samples is critical in botany, agriculture, and environmental studies.
This project leverages CNN for automatic feature extraction from images and machine learning models for classification, delivering an end-to-end leaf identification system.

Features:
✅ Detects and classifies leaves of multiple tree species
✅ Handles different forms, shapes, and image qualities
✅ Trains using real-world leaf image dataset
✅ Supports inference for new, unseen leaf images
✅ Modular architecture (CNN + Machine Learning pipeline)
